### How to write a circuit in halo2

1. Define a Config struct that holds the columns used in the circuit
2. Define a Chip struct that configures the constraints in the circuit and provides assignment functions
3. Define a circuit struct that implements the Circuit trait and
4. Instantiate a circuit instance and feed it into the prover

## Steps

### 1. Write circuits

### 2. Generate Onchain verifier

> Requirement: install `solc`

### 3. WASM prover (WIP)
